                I have lived with cats for all my life, so i'm much more used to them than dogs. Also, they are so adorable and cuddly once they get to know you. Even though you may like the fact that dogs are super hyper, I personally don't enjoy that as much as some people do and enjoy just the sweet quietness of me and my cats cuddling. I'm not sure if everyone elses cat does this but mine wake me up in the morning by pressing on my back with their tiny paws and look down at me <i>MENACINGLY</i>, I find it absolutely adorable. One thing I love about cats is that they're so curious about the world and want to explore, even though my cats can be fat lil bums, once they find something new they investiage it like they're a detective. Even though I'm sadly allergic to cats, I still love them with all my heart. I find it funny that cats come from these wild hunters that are so scary while cats now look like lil squishy beans... Evolution I guess. Anyway, if you bully me for liking cats (like my fifth grade teacher did) you're wrong, your mean, and I love cats no matter what.
